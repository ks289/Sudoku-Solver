# Sudoku-Solver
This is a Sudoku solver written in Python3. Given a 2D array of a starting board, where -1 denotes a blank/empty tile, will determine if the puzzle is solvable or not by recursively attempting all solutions. This program doesn't find if the puzzle is valid, i.e. there is exactly one solution.
